# DistortionViewer
Use OSG and Qt to display various camera model distortion effect.

This program includes several camera model including ordinary barrel distortion effect,fisheye distortion effect and the panorama distortion effect. All these model comes from different papers with some thoughts of myself which means there are no guarantee about the accuracy of the effect displayed. However, I suppose this as a good simulation of different types of cameras as an application of post process in OSG.
